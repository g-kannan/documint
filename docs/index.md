## Vision
Our vision is to build a scalable, reliable, and modular data engineering platform that accelerates decision-making across the organization.

We aim to:

- Empower data teams to deliver faster with confidence.
- Standardize data pipelines using best practices and frameworks.
- Ensure high data quality, observability, and governance.
- Facilitate seamless integration across diverse platforms and business domains.

This documentation serves as a single source of truth for how we design, implement, test, and operate data systems.
