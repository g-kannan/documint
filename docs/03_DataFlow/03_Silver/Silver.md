### Common Alias: 
Curated Zone, Refined Layer

### Goal: 
In the Silver layer of the lakehouse, the data from the Bronze layer is matched, merged, conformed and cleansed ("just-enough") so that the Silver layer can provide an "Enterprise view" of all its key business entities, concepts and transactions. (e.g. master customers, stores, non-duplicated transactions and cross-reference tables).
